Easygen is an eclipse plugin or a standalone application to generate code using various modules (basically to generate a CRUD application).
You should consider the generated code as a start for new project.

Easygen connects to a database from which you select some tables, then you choose the modules you want to generate.

Current supported modules :
> - Hibernate for ORM
> - Java Pojo services or Spring for the service layer
> - Struts2 for the view layer

Service and View layer is optional.
